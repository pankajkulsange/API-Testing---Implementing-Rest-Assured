# API Automation Project

## Overview
This project is an API automation testing framework developed to validate the functionality, reliability, and performance of APIs. The framework is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to use.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: [e.g., Java, Python, etc.]
- Testing Framework: [e.g., RestAssured, Postman, etc.]
- Build Tool: [e.g., Maven, Gradle, etc.]
- Test Runner: [e.g., TestNG, JUnit, etc.]
- Reporting Tool: [e.g., ExtentReports, etc.]
- Other Tools: [e.g., JSONPath, Apache HttpClient, etc.]

Key Features
1. Modular Design
The framework is organized in a way that separates concerns like test cases, utility functions, and configurations for better maintainability.
2. Data-Driven Testing
Test data is externalized in JSON/XML files, making it easy to run the same test cases with different inputs.
3. Configuration Management
Environment-specific configurations (like base URLs, credentials) are maintained separately, allowing easy switching between different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
4. Reusable Utility Functions
Common functionalities like HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and logging are encapsulated in utility classes.
5. Comprehensive Reporting
Test results are automatically generated in detailed reports using [e.g., Allure, ExtentReports], providing insights into test execution and outcomes.
